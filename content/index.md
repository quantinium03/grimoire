### Personal  
I live in a bustling metro area and work as a generalist at a managed service provider (MSP). My core expertise lies in designing and implementing infrastructure, networking, cybersecurity, and identity access management (IAM).  

After hours, I dive into personal projects—think experimental tech ventures and creative side hustles. I unwind with non-fiction reads, manga, or the occasional gaming session (FPS, MMOs). Recently, I’ve been exploring VR, which has been a fun new rabbit hole.  

A typical day kicks off around 7 AM, work runs from 8 AM to 6 PM, and I’m usually up until 2 AM— netting me about 5-6 hours of sleep. (I’ve mused more about my sleep habits [here]). The quiet late-night and early-morning hours are my sweet spot for deep work: no noise, no distractions, just focus. Definitely a night owl at heart—there’s something magical about those AM hours for getting stuff done.  

I’m active in online communities—think tech forums, social platforms, and niche networking groups—often under various pseudonyms. I’ve also volunteered for a national communications service for over a decade, mostly hands-on.
