## Tips
- **Do the exercises!** Don't just read.
- **Learning to code is done by coding.** Build terminal applications, build simple HTTP servers, build tools you might want to use. Nothing is too complicated.
- **Study the fundamentals.** Data structures, algorithms. Networking. How does memory work? What happens when you type `google.com` in your search bar?
- **Look underneath software you use.** A lot of software is open-source. Consume a lot of code. Be curious.
- **If you have a specific career path and/or just want to enter the job market** â€” you can DM or @ me on X.
