# Recommended Resources for Learning Machine Learning (ML)

## You Want to Get Into How ML Works Beneath the Frameworks
- **"Understanding Deep Learning"** by Simon J. D. Prince
- **"The Hundred Pages Machine Learning Book"** by Andriy Burkov
- **"The Little Book of Deep Learning"** by François Fleuret

## You Lack the Math Skills to Read the Above
- **"Mathematics for Machine Learning"** by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong
- **"Linear Algebra Done Right"** by Sheldon Axler
- **"Linear Algebra"** by 3Blue1Brown (YouTube series)

## You Just Want to Do ML
- **FastAI Book**
- **FastAI Video Course**

## You Want to Learn About LLMs (Large Language Models)
- **Karpathy's YouTube Channel** — This has the most amount of signal and the highest amount of alpha to learn about LLMs and building GPT-2 level transformer models.

## Tips
- **Do the exercises, always.**
  - You're not learning math if you don't do the exercises.
  - You're not learning ML if you don't build models! Train them from scratch! Implement a multi-layer perceptron from scratch!
- **Tinker after chapters/videos.**
  - Tweak the examples or exercises.
  - Build simple models.
  - Build yet another MNIST classifier, but tinker!
